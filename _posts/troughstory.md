It looks like an old well, this round concrete trough off to the side of the road in the heart of what was once the bustling Smith County community of New Middleton.

Covered with a green skim and a few leaves, rainwater stands three feet deep in the humble trough, which forms a circle about 18 feet in circumference. You probably wouldn't want to dip your hand in here, much less sip its murky water. 

Most likely this shady hole in the road rarely catches the eye of those who drive past.

But come every fourth Saturday in September, two dozen or so old-timers gather beside this waterhole, once the epicenter of their small universe, and in their minds travel back in time to when they were youngsters as they spin tales and share memories from "the good ole days."
While a few travel a couple of hundred miles to be here, most of them hang their hats in Smith and Wilson counties. With affection they have dubbed this annual rite "meeting at the trough." 

"We've been doing this about five years," said trough organizer Kenneth House, 71, who lives in Brush Creek but grew up in New Middleton. "The way we got started, Delano Washer, a fellow used to live here, and he was moved off to Texas, and he called me one time and said, `I'd like to see Ed Crawford.' He said he'd like to get together and talk over some old times, and that was how this happened. 

"When we were boys, Saturday afternoon was go-to-town day so that's how we picked Saturday, because after jumping around the farm all week we were ready for a little rest on the weekend. Everybody come to town on Saturday afternoons, and that was big doings back in that era.

"Mom and the women up there in the holler couldn't understand. What it was was a calling card for the kids to go to town. The women nicknamed New Middleton `the glory hole.' They'd say, `Well, they've gone down to the glory hole.'

"All the boys wanted to go down there and get away from work and spend time with each other. Back in winter in the stores they'd have a Rook game or checkers or be throwing horseshoes to pass a little time," recalled House.

Back in the 1930s and '40s, New Middleton boasted five general stores and a pharmacy. The businesses changed hands over the decades but among the storekeepers were Paul Bass, Sam Barrett, Ralph Holbrook, L. Ferguson, Elmer House, Glenn Coffee, A.T. Morris, Ernest Smith, John and Lige Kent, Carl Baird, Charlie Neal and Glenn and Esker Clyde Winfree. Fires eventually brought the structures to the ground.

The town also boasted a filling station, a saw mill, garage and blacksmith shop. Horseshoe pits provided mild physical entertainment in the rear of Coffee's Store. After it burned in 1937, the pits were moved across the road next to the watering trough, but the stakes and shoes are long gone, and there's been nary a game pitched here in decades.

However, conversations of yesterday thrive this one day of the year when a hearty band of men, most of them between 70 and 90 years in age, show up beside the intersection of highways 141 and 53. Beneath the shade of an ancient elm they toss around stories as if they were boys playing catch with a baseball. Most of the tales surround working on the farm for their fathers, what happened to old so-and-so and talk of cars, athletic events and days of old lang syne.

"You can believe half of what you hear here," warns James Robert Bass, who owns this sacred ground. A large metal shed nearby used to hold the rolling stock of his family's funeral home business: a horse-drawn hearse, an ambulance and flower car among other vehicles.

But Joe Holbrook of Lebanon knows the gospel truth about the trough. His father, Ralph Holbrook, who operated a cash store here from 1939 to 1965, built the round waterhole in 1941.

"Many a mule, horse drank from there. Boys, too," said Holbrook. "There were fish in there, horses would slobber in there. We'd stick our heads in there and drink.
 
"There is a spring up the hollow about a quarter mile. He had a pipe up that branch. It had enough pressure come down to here," he said of the gravity flow that kept the trough filled with fresh water.

"If it got stopped up with a few gravel or crawfish, he'd bring a pump down here and blow it out the other end. There were no baptisms, but some people have been thrown in there," he says with a grin. 

"People, they'd come here to the stores in the '40s. They'd ride wagons, mules, buggies and horses to get their groceries. There was not only our store, but four other stores here. You can't imagine them all being busy."

What brings him back to this spot late in September?
 
"It's so many things that happened that I don't remember. I get to talk with these people to get our stories about preschool days and schooldays and where we are today. Everyone has a story, he noted.

About half an hour before noon a gentleman announces, "Here comes the keynote speaker right now." 

He's referring to Bill House, who has the food. Around a small table, the men share a blessing of thanks for the meal and then dive into bologna and cheese sandwiches, crackers, baked beans, soft drinks and Moon Pies, a meal fit for a country boy king.

Today's congregation includes four natives, the Carson brothers: Robert, 89; Glenn, 82; John. 79; and Paul, 76.

"I grew up in a holler 2(1/2) miles from here," said Robert, the elder. "I had to walk 2(1/2) miles out here to catch the bus. First we'd go to Brush Creek, then to Sykes and Hickman to Gordonsville [High School]."

At last year's reunion, Glenn Carson, who lives in Mt. Juliet, made cedar walking sticks for every man who attended. Each stick holds a Lincoln penny and has the letters "M.A.T.T." inscribed on it. The letters stand for "Meeting at the Trough."

Albert Allison, who grew up in the Saulsbury community and as a youth played on baseball teams for Buckeye Corner, Grant and Watertown, says he came this year because, "It's been so long since I saw 'em. They look familiar, but you've got to check 'em out to find out."

Obviously, it's a far different world from when these men were young, but a sentimental journey one day a year gives them a mighty fine feeling.

"Back when country stores were there, you kept informed about who was sick, who moved in and who moved out the community, the news," said House. "Now it's people move into the area and you don't know 'em, don't ever seen 'em, maybe pass on the road and see who they are. It was a better time. 

"The first year we met there was grown men walking around with big old tears in their eyes. A lot of 'em hadn't seen each other in many, many years. It was an opportunity to get reacquainted and visit a little bit," he said. 

"There's lots of good memories being exchanged here," said Don Kyle, one of the junior men in this group, who grew up in Commerce and lives in Cookeville. "I appreciate the silent history they taught us: silent examples. 

"It's an inspiration for me to see some of these fellows keeping these stories alive and appreciating their roots. A very dear and precious memory to them."

As the meeting at the trough begins to break up in early afternoon, the parting words are spoken: "Same time next year." 

Lord willing, they will return.
